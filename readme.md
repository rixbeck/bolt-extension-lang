Multi language site helper Extension for Bolt CMS
=================================================

Very early stage of an extension that should provide helper components for a Bolt CMS
multi lingual site.

My thought is I'm going to collect different approaches handling and serving language
versions of the content handled with Bolt. This collection of library will provide
twig helper methods and routing mechanism upon some API that reach the right content
data for the specific language.

To be continued...
